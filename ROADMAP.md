# Frontend Roadmap

## Database

- improves site performance
- allows to query by tag and query by search
- allows to automatically generate a displayUri for old objkts (audio, images, etc)

## Social sharing

In order to implement SSR I would suggest we migrate from RCA to Next.js. Next.js acts as a single page application but also as a static site generator. which will allow us to generate html pages for all the objkts.

We can consider other solutions to avoid migration to next.js.
