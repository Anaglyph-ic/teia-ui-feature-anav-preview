# FAQ

Welcome to minting your first OBJKTs on Hicetunc. This open source project was launched March 1 and is still in its alpha stages. Below you’ll find guides to minting.

Please keep in mind that the site is being actively worked on by contributors who work on a volunteer basis, and features are constantly being pushed and updated to the site. This FAQ page will try to keep in sync with the newest features and be updated as much as possible, but if some things don’t seem to match, please consult our discord.

## How to mint

Starting at the homepage, from the hamburger menu, select “Sync" or “OBJKTS (mint NFTs)”. This will cause your browser to prompt you to sync with your wallet. Once you are synced, you should see your profile with a unique generated avatar.

Now that you are synced, you can then try again to hit the “OBJKTS (mint NFTs)” button, and you can proceed to fill out the information for your OBJKT. The number of OBJKTs means the edition number. You can input the price of the OBJKT after the minting is complete.

After you hit [mint], you will be asked for approval from your wallet, and the Tezos transaction will go through. You will be taken back to your dashboard while the Tezos transaction is confirmed in the blockchain. You can either check back on the homepage, or click on “Manage Assets” to see if your OBJKT is done minting and available.

Based on the edition number that you minted, you will see a number of “OBJKTS” in your tezos wallet. These newly minted OBJKTs now belong to you.

At this point your OBJKT doesn’t have a price on it. It will show up on the homepage as “Not for sale”. Continue to the curate section to learn how to set prices to your OBJKTs.

## How to sell your OBJKT (swap)

Let’s say I want to set the price of all 10 of my edition of 10. Click on your OBJKT's link to see the details, and if you are still synced to your wallet, you should see a “Swap” and/or “Burn” option next to “info” and “owners”. (If you don’t see these options, then you have to sync your wallet again.)

Input how many OBJKTs out of your edition that you want to set for sale, and how much each should cost in Tezos, then hit the [swap] button.

When you are curating, you are sending an amount of OBJKTs of your edition out of your wallet. This is called a swap. Once the blockchain transaction is finished, the price should be set on the OBJKT and available for purchase, and your wallet should say that you sent that amount of OBJKTs. You might have to reload a couple of times to see if the transaction went through. Times vary for how long the confirmation should take, but it usually takes a couple of minutes.

## How to cancel

Let’s say I want to lower or raise my price, or set my OBJKTs as “not for sale”. Make sure your wallet is synced, and click on [cancel]. This will send the OBJKTs back to your wallet. Now that they are back in your wallet, you can [swap] them again.

If you try to [swap] on OBJKTs that you have already set the price for, your wallet will throw a warning saying that you have insufficient funds. This is because you already sent your OBJKTs out of your wallet in the first swap. You need to [cancel] the curation to get the OBJKTs back in your wallet, and then you can [swap] them again.

## How to burn :fire:

The [burn] button allows you to burn the NFT.

NOTE: You need to [cancel] the curation of this OBJKT so it can be available in your wallet when you are ready to burn it.

However, at the moment, burned tokens still appear in your wallet. We are working to update API to filter the burned OBJKTs.

*As of 3/17 this feature is not yet implemented.*
*There is a workaround where you may send the desired burned work to the burn address directly from your Tezos wallet.
The address is: tz1burnburnburnburnburnburnburjAYjjX
_NOTE:_ The OBJKT will still stay listed on your profile, so this method is not recommended.*

## How to find buyers

Unfortunately, there are people minting NFTs who did not create what they upload. These copyminters, as we call it, try to make quick buck with art from other people. Collectors have to very careful and try to find out who the artists are and if the art is genuine. 

To make it easier for them, please leave a trace to any social profile or website in the description of your artwork, so potential buyers can validate the authenticity. 

## How to get verified
